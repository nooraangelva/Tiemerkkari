According to the guidelines issued by the Finnish Road Administration, road traf-
fic markings must be painted on the road surface mechanically. As a result of this
policy, the client commissioned this thesis. The aim of the thesis was to deve-
lop a prototype of a product package tailored to road marking, which included a
working application that acted as the user interface of the device, controlling the
microcontroller. The end users of the product will be road marking contractors.
The thesis progressed using agile methods, as weeklong sprints. The sprints al-
lowed for a quick response to potential challenges and changes. A 15-minute
“daily Scrum” was also held daily to track progress and seek new perspectives on
tackling challenges.
The actual development work of the thesis consisted of the development of an
Android-based application that controls the microcontroller that manages the prin-
ter which prints the sign. The user interface was developed in collaboration with a
client who represented the users of the final product. The boundary conditions set
by the client and the limits set by the authors were considered in the design. The
aim was to establish communication between the application and the printer wire-
lessly, without network dependence, so Bluetooth was chosen as the connection
provider. The microcontroller selected in the prototype controls the servomotors
that controlled the two axes of the printer that moved in the 2D plane. The axes
were used to move a pen in the prototype, which modelled the trajectory of five
different road signs.
As a result of the work, a working prototype of the application was created and
with the help of this it was verified that the proof of concept is a functional solu-
tion to be implemented in production use.
